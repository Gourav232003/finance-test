## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.7+**
  * **pip** (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/finance-tracker.git
    cd finance-tracker
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    The `run_finance_tracker.py` script automatically generates the `requirements.txt` file inside the `backend` directory. You can install the dependencies from there.

    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

Simply execute the main script from the project's root directory:

```bash
python run_finance_tracker.py
```

This script will perform the following actions:

1.  **Start the Flask backend server** 🚀 at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  **Automatically open the frontend** 🌐 (`frontend/index.html`) in your default web browser.

You should see a confirmation message in your terminal.

## 🛑 How to Stop

To shut down the application, simply press **`CTRL+C`** in the terminal where the script is running.
